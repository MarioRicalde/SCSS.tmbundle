This is a TextMate Bundle for [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) SCSS Syntax.

This bundle contains the grammar files for highlighting the NEW SYNTAX; the old syntax is not supported by this bundle. Sorry.

It also includes Zen CSS ( from the Zen Coding Project ); which will help you speed up your coding.
